# pfSense Home Lab - Network Segmentation Firewall Rules

### üéØ Project Goal
Simulate a real-world home or small office network using pfSense to:

‚Ä¢ Implement network segmentation using VLANs or subnetting                                                                                                                                                                                         
‚Ä¢ Create and enforce firewall rules between networks                                                                                                                                                   
‚Ä¢ Configure services like DHCP, DNS, and NAT                                                                                                                                                   
‚Ä¢ Monitor and analyze traffic flows with tools like Wireshark                                                                                                                                                   

Demonstrates an understanding of core networking, access control, and secure architecture.                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                   
# pfSense Home Lab ‚Äì Network Segmentation & Firewall Rules

## üìå Objective
This lab demonstrates a secure home/small-office network built using pfSense. It includes multiple internal LANs, firewall rules for network segmentation, and basic services like DNS and DHCP.

## üß± Network Design
![Network Diagram](./network-diagram.png)

- LAN 1: 192.168.10.0/24 (Trusted - Internal Servers)
- LAN 2: 192.168.20.0/24 (Users/Clients)
- Goal: Restrict LAN 2 from accessing LAN 1, but allow DNS & HTTP

## Tools & Technologies
- pfSense 2.7
- VirtualBox or VMware
- Ubuntu Server 22.04
- Windows 10 VM
- Wireshark (for traffic analysis)

## Key Features
- VLAN/subnet-based network segmentation
- Firewall rule enforcement
- DHCP and DNS setup
- Packet capture and traffic inspection

## üìÅ Repo Structure
- `/firewall-rules`: Text-based copies of firewall configs and rationale
- `/configurations`: DHCP, DNS, and pfSense config snippets
- `/packet-captures`: Wireshark files (.pcapng) to analyze blocked/allowed traffic
- `/screenshots`: UI configs for visual understanding
- `/documentation`: Design decisions and traffic analysis reports

## Future Additions
- Add intrusion detection using Suricata or Snort
- Add VPN access from external network
- Automate log forwarding to a SIEM

## Author Notes
This project is part of a cybersecurity analyst prep series focused on building practical skills in networking, monitoring, and access control.
