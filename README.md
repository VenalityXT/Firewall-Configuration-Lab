# pfSense Home Lab - Network Segmentation Firewall Rules

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
Simulate a real-world home or small office network using pfSense to:

â€¢ Implement network segmentation using VLANs or subnetting
â€¢ Create and enforce firewall rules between networks
â€¢ Configure services like DHCP, DNS, and NAT
â€¢ Monitor and analyze traffic flows with tools like Wireshark

This shows you understand core networking, access control, and secure architectureâ€”all of which are crucial for cybersecurity analyst or SOC roles.
