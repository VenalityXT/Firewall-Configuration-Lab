# pfSense Home Lab - Network Segmentation Firewall Rules

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
Simulate a real-world home or small office network using pfSense to:

â€¢ Implement network segmentation using VLANs or subnetting                                                                                                                                                                                         
â€¢ Create and enforce firewall rules between networks                                                                                                                                                   
â€¢ Configure services like DHCP, DNS, and NAT                                                                                                                                                   
â€¢ Monitor and analyze traffic flows with tools like Wireshark                                                                                                                                                   

Demonstrates an understanding of core networking, access control, and secure architecture.
