# 🧱 pfSense Setup

A step-by-step guide to installing and configuring **pfSense CE** as the core firewall in a virtualized home lab, including WAN/LAN setup and initial hardening.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- **VirtualBox** (or compatible hypervisor)
- **pfSense ISO**
- At least **2 virtual NICs** (1 for WAN, 1 for LAN/VLAN trunk)
- Optional: Additional NIC for true DMZ isolation via physical disk mapping

---

## 🖥️ Create the pfSense Virtual Machine

1. **Create New VM**:
   - Name: `pfSense`
   - Type: `BSD`, Version: `FreeBSD (64-bit)`
   - Memory: ≥ 2048 MB
   - Disk: Dynamically allocated, ≥ 10 GB

2. **Attach pfSense ISO** to the virtual CD/DVD drive.

3. **Configure Network Adapters**:
   - **Adapter 1 (WAN)**: NAT
   - **Adapter 2 (LAN)**: Internal Network (`intnet`)

---

## 🧪 pfSense Installation

1. Boot the VM from ISO.
2. Choose **Install pfSense** → Accept defaults.
3. Select `Auto (UFS)` or `ZFS` for disk partitioning.
4. Wait for installation to complete → Reboot (remove ISO).

Note:
If you don't forcefully inject the ISO after you finish configuring pfSense it will automatically reboot into the setup chain again.

## 🌐 Initial Interface Assignment

On reboot:

1. **Assign interfaces**:
   - WAN → `em0` (attached to NAT)
   - LAN → `em1` (internal)

2. Confirm assignments when prompted.

3. You should see:
   ```
   WAN  -> 192.168.x.x (from NAT DHCP)
   LAN  -> 192.168.1.1
   ```

---

## 🔐 First-Time Web Login

1. On a VM or host with access to LAN:
   - Open browser → go to [http://192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1)
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `pfsense`

2. Complete the **pfSense setup wizard**:
   - Change hostname, DNS, and admin password
   - Configure WAN as DHCP (default)
   - Set LAN IP manually (e.g., `10.10.10.1/24`)

---

## 🚧 Basic Hardening & Tweaks

- **Change admin password**
- Disable **anti-lockout rule** only after enabling alternate access
- Enable **SSH** (optional, with key-based login)
- Apply latest updates via System → Update
