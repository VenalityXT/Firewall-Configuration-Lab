# Firewall Rules

A detailed guide to implementing a **default-deny firewall strategy** in pfSense, tailored for VLAN isolation, secure egress, and minimal exposure between zones.

---

## Firewall Strategy Overview

- **Default deny** on all interfaces
- Allow only required **egress traffic**
- Prevent inter-VLAN traffic unless explicitly required
- Enforce isolation for IoT and DMZ
- Enable **logging** on key rule actions

## Test Each Rule Set

1. Attempt ping or HTTP request from each VLAN to another.
2. Try accessing internal services from IoT/DMZ â€” should be blocked.
3. Use **Diagnostics > States** and **Logs** to validate traffic behavior.
